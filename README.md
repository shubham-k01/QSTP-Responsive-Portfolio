# QSTP-Responsive-Portfolio

This Portfolio website is built using Tailwind CSS framework and is using the various utility based classes available in Tailwind.
Also this website has a responsive design , meaning it changes the content of the page and its arrangement according to the device size. 
This is done using the breakpoints that are available in Tailwind , which behind the scenes implement media queries to make it responsive.
